What you can do ? 

Comment.

time? - Will display a current time. 
date? - Will display the current date.

el president? - Will give you some arbitrary mission statement and ask you if you want more information. Do this and it will give you a way to reach out and engage with the content ... now thats' Technocracy at its best !! 


Missing:

> parser for javscript string to html element - so the bot displays <url> tags </url>

> Auto-scrolling for new posts
> Punkbuster-type censoring for injections, and words registered by the content provider as age-restricted and or malice.
